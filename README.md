## Term-Notes Installer üöÄ

[![Installer Success](https://img.shields.io/badge/Installer-Success-orange)](https://github.com/felipealfonsog/TermNotes)

Hey there! üëã I'm excited to share that I successfully created a convenient Bash installer for Term-Notes, a terminal-based note-taking application.

üìù With this installer, you can effortlessly install Term-Notes on your Mac OS or Linux system by executing a simple script. No more hassles with manual compilation or dependencies!

üöÄ The installer takes care of everything: downloading the source code, compiling the program, and even checking for Homebrew or Linux package managers to ensure smooth installation.

üíª Whether you're on Mac OS or Linux, the installer streamlines the process, so you can focus on taking notes without any hassle.

By the way, we had some hurdles along the way. Homebrew didn't accept our project, but screw it! üòÑ We persevered and made it happen, developing an easy-to-use installer with some cool ASCII ART!

#### To Install it: 
To install Term-Notes, simply run the installer script available [here](https://github.com/felipealfonsog/TermNotes/blob/main/installer.sh).

Or just Copy - Paste in your terminal and use wget to start downloading the installer:

   ```
   wget https://github.com/felipealfonsog/TermNotes/blob/main/installer.sh
   ```

   On macOS to download - wget - just install it with Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install wget
   ```

#### Important note when installing:

If you encounter issues executing the file in the terminal, follow these simple steps to fix it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the installer script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following command to grant execute permission to the installer script:

   ```
   chmod +x installer.sh
   ```
   
4. Now you can run the installer without any problems.

   ```
   ./installer.sh
   ```

Now type 'term-notes' in the terminal and enjoy using Term-Notes! üòäüöÄ

#### Project Availability Update: Homebrew Rejection

[![Homebrew Rejected](https://img.shields.io/badge/Homebrew-Not%20Accepted-yellow)](https://github.com/TermNotes)

I regret to inform you that the project, Term Notes, has been rejected by Homebrew for publication in their package repository. This means that Linux users from different distros, unfortunately, won't be able to install Term Notes directly through Homebrew. However, we have an alternative solution for Arch Linux users!

Term Notes can still be installed through the YAY package manager, ensuring Arch Linux users can enjoy the benefits of the note-taking application. Simply follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation to install Term Notes using YAY.

For users on other Linux distributions and macOS, don't worry! You can still compile and use the binary file from the cloned GitHub project repository. Although it won't be installed system-wide, you can run the application directly from the project folder. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
